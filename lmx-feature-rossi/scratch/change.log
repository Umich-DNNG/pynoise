### PlotWrapper.py
@JH: 12/17/2022: Started tracking the version here
@JH: 12/17/2022: updated Np data
@JH: 01/07/2023: added single and double Y2 fitting
@JH: 01/08/2023: additional added single and double Y2 fitting
@JH: 02/03/2023: added Ym
@JH: 02/03/2023: added Rossi-alpha
@JH: 02/04/2023: normalize Feynman histograms
@JH: 02/05/2023: R2 with both Y2 terms

@JH: 02/11/2023: Added in the ability to read the header
@JH: 02/11/2023: For Feynman Y two term fit or Rossi two exp fit, B is forced to be > D. If it is not, then the term names are all swapped
@JH: 02/11/2023: Added capability to output .csv file with Y2 fit information
@JH: 02/11/2023: Added Rossi data .csv file output
@JH: 02/11/2023: combine_Y2_rate_results has now been verified and is an available user specification
@JH: 02/12/2023: Bug fix related to combine_Y2_rate_results
@JH: 02/12/2023: Modified to use input_paths, output_paths, and output_subdirectory_paths
@JH: 02/15/2023: Bug fix related to csv outputs for plot_all_files_vs_con
@JH: 02/17/2023: Added support for sum_Feynman_histograms
@JH: 02/18/2023: Bug fix related to combine_Y2_rate_results
@JH: 02/19/2023: Added support for compare_combine_sum
@JH: 02/19/2023: Modified combine_Y2_rate_results to use weighted averages
@JH: 02/20/2023: Bug fix associated with Ym and dYm using sum_Feynman_histograms (typo)
@JH: 02/21/2023: Added statistical plots to combine_Y2_rate_results
@JH: 02/24/2023: added eff from 'Cf' calculation type
@JH: 02/25/2023: Modified to allow sum_Feynman_histograms when plot_histograms is False (to speed up the code if those plots are not desired)
@JH: 03/05/2023: Added ability to run compare_combine_Y2_rate_results_and_Feynman_sum utilizing filepaths that have not been created yet
@JH: 03/05/2023: removed "remove last two entries" option. Now gate-widths are forced to be in ascending order.
@JH: 03/08/2023: added support for 'Multiplicity' calculation type
@JH: 03/10/2023: added support for .csv files
@JH: 03/11/2023: added option to output limited gatewidths when using plot_all_files_vs_con (user_gatewidths_plot_all_files_vs_con)
@JH: 03/16/2023: added ability to compare sum histograms, combined, and a single file (compare_individual_file_and_combine_Y2_rate_results_and_Feynman_sum)
@JH: 03/17/2023: modified how combine_Y2_rate_results uses R2 and onward data

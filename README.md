# PyNoise Project

Welcome to the PyNoise Project! The goal of this Python suite is to process and analyze radiation data recorded from fission reactions. Our supported methods of analysis currently include Rossi Alpha and Power Spectral Density. For more information about these methods, please see the README files in the respective subdirectory.

## How to Use



### Requirements

To run the PyNoise project, the following programs must be downloaded:
* driver.py
* editor.py
* settings.py
* main.py
* analyzingFolders.py
* timeDifs.py
* plots.py
* fitting.py

Additionally, you will need the following:
* A single file or folder of data that will be analyzed.
* A settings configuration file (see the settings section for more information).

### Settings Configurations

The PyNoise program can be run with a variety of options that change the visual output and type of analysis being run. This section will outline each subgroup of settings and the acceptable values for each parameter. There are different categories of settings as follows:  

**I/O FILE INFO**: This group contains information about the input and output details of the program.
* Input file/folder (*path*): users should input the absolute or relative path to the file/folder that the user wants analyzed. See specific method README files for the exact formatting of these inputs. **Please avoid naming folders with periods, as our program differentiates between files and folders by counting periods in the input name.**
* Data column (*int*): TODO: Write explanation for this.
* Save directory (*path*): Should a user desire to save graphs generated by the program, this absolute or relative path to a folder will be where the graphs are saved.
* Keep logs (*boolean*): If true, logs will be kept in the (hidden) .logs folder that keep track of changes made to the settings and types of analyses run.

**GENERAL PROGRAM SETTINGS**: This section contains general program settings that are applied to all methods of analysis.
* Fit range (*list of ints*): The beginning and end points of where the data will be fit.
* Number of folders (*int*): When analyzing a folder of data, this specifies how many folders within the given directory should be analyzed.
* Meas time per folder (*int*): TODO: what is this for?
* Sort data (*boolean*): If true, the time stamps given in the input files will be sorted from least to greatest.
* Save figures (*boolean*): If true, graphs generated by the program will be saved to the specified directory.
* Show plots (*boolean*): If true, graphs generated by the program will appear on screen when created.

**ROSSIALPHA SETTINGS**: This section has settings specific to Rossi Alpha analysis. Please see the Rossi Alpha README file for more information.

**PSD SETTINGS**: This section has settings specific to Power Spectral Density analysis. Please see the PSD README file for more information.

**HISTOGRAM VISUAL SETTINGS**: These settings correspond to the built-in matplotlib histogram settings for whenever the program generates a bar graph. See https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html for full documentation of options. All options on the website are supported.

**LINE FITTING SETTINGS**: These settings correspond to the built-in matplotlib plot settings for whenever the program generates a line of best fit for data. See https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html for full documentation of options. All options on the website are supported.

**RESIDUAL PLOT SETTINGS**: These settings correspond to the built-in matplotlib plot settings for whenever the program generates a residual graph for the line of best fit. See https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html for full documentation of options. All options on the website are supported. 

### Settings Input Format
Default or custom settings can be imported into the program and can be changed during runtime. For the program to read in the settings correctly, the file extension must be .set and must have the following formatting:
1. The file can begin with any number of comments (lines that start with #)
2. Each settings group must have a header of the correct name and must have its contents surrounded by a comment line on either side (dashed lines are commonly used but the comment line can contain anything)
3. Input/Output, General, and Histogram Generation Settings must always have the same settings.
4. Other settings groups can have a variable number of parameters.
5. Settings can come in any order within a group.

See the default.set format for examples.


### Driver
```driver.py``` provides the user with an interactive command line driver program, which when ran can either use the default settings file (```default.set```) or users can import a different settings file. Follow initial instructions to choose .set file.   
**Using Driver**   
The main menu has 5 main options:
* m - run the entire program through the [main driver](#main)
* t - calculate [time differences](#time-difference-calculator)
* p - create [plots](#rossihistogram) of the time difference data
* f - [fit](#fitting) the data to an exponential curve
* s - view or edit the program [settings](#settings-configurations)
* Leave the command blank to end the program.


### Editor
Settings can be edited live during runtime using a vim. This operation is handled by ```editor.py```.

**Editor Options**

There are a few choices when using the settings editor:
* c - edit/view the current runtime settings.
* i - overwrite current settings with an imported .set file.
* n - create a blank settings file.

**vim Commands**

When editing settings, a vim editor will open in the command tab. There are a couple of essential commands that should be known to be able to effectively modify the settings.

When in view mode:
* $ - Go to the end of the current line
* 0 - Go to the beginning of the current line
* Shift + arrow key: Go mutiple spaces in the direction of the arrow

To enter/exit editing mode:
* s or a - enter editing mode
* ctrl + C: exit editing mode:

To close the vim:
* :wq or :exit

*WARNING*: Try to avoid exiting/quitting the program while in the editing vim. To use vim, temporary files are created that will not be correctly deleted if vim editing is halted incorrectly. Additionally, the entire terminal tab formatting may be affected.

### Main
```main.py``` contains two functions, one for file type 1 and one for file type 2. ```analyzeAllType1(settings)``` calculates the time differences of a type 1 file, constructs a histogram, and fits a curve to the histogram, and constructs a residuals plot. It uses the settings dictionary to do these functions.   
```analyzeAllType2(settings)``` calculates the time differences for the file within each folder, constructs a histogram, fits a curve to each histogram, then constructs a scatterplot of all of the combined data and fits a curve to it

### Time Difference Calculator
```timeDifs.py``` contains a class, ```TimeDifsCalcs``` that can be initialized with the time data (a list of sorted detection times), the reset time, the method that we will be using, the digital delay, and the corresponding channels to the time data (if not using any_and_all method).

**Using Time Difference Calculator**
```python
from RossiAlpha.timeDifs import * #imports all classes from file
thisTimeDifCalc = timeDifCalcs(list_data, 2e3, any_and_all) #constructs an object called thisTimeDifCalc with a reset time of 2000 and method = any_and_all
time_diffs = thisTimeDifCalc.calculate_time_differences() #saves the array of time diffs as time_diffs
```

### RossiHistogram
In the plots.py file, there is a class called ```RossiHistogram``` which is a class that bins the data. There is one function under ```RossiHistogram``` called ```plot(self, time_diffs, save_every_fig, show_plot)```, in which the input parameter time_diffs is an array of time differences generated from the ```timeDifCalcs``` class.

**Using RossiHistogram**
```python
from RossiAlpha.plots import * #imports all classes from file
thisPlot = RossiHistogram(reset_time = 2e3, bin_width = 2, histogram_visual_settings, save_dir = '/path/to/save/plot.png') #construct a RossiHistogram object specifying the reset time, bin width, visual settings, and (optional) path to where you want plot to save
counts, bin_centers, bin_edges = thisPlot.plot(time_diffs, save_fig="yes", show_plot="no") #constructs the histogram with the time differences and saves it to the save_dir
#Returns the counts,bin_centers, and bin_edges for later use
```


### Fitting
In the fitting.py file, there are two classes. One is called ```RossiHistogramFit``` and the other one is called ```Fit_With_Weighting```. The difference between the two classes is that "Fit_With_Weighting" deals with input type 1, as well as creating uncertainty plots. In ```RossiHistogramFit``` there are two functions called "fit()" and "fit_and_residual()", the former is used to fit an exponential decay curve onto the histogram and the latter produces a residual plot on top of the curve fitting.

fit_and_residual() function will do the same thing as Fit.fit(), execept that it will plot the relative residuals onto a plot right below the curve fitting plot. Thus, the images produced will have two plots that correspond to a line fitted for a histogram and a residua plot describing how well the line is fitting at each Time Difference (ns) unit. 

**Using Fitting**


```python
thisFit = RossiHistogramFit(counts, bin_centers, settings) #construct the fit object
# Fitting curve to the histogram and plotting the residuals
#saves the plot with a fit on top and residuals on bottonm but does not show it
thisFit.fit_and_residual(save_every_fig=True, show_plot=False)
```
```python
RA_hist_total = analyzingFolders.compile_sample_stdev_RA_dist(settings)
from fitting import Fit_With_Weighting
thisWeightedFit = Fit_With_Weighting(RA_hist_total,min_cutoff = , general_settings,saveDir, fitting_opts, residual_opts)
#creates the fit to the data 
thisWeightedFit.fit_RA_hist_weighting()
#plots the histogram
thisWeightedFit.plot_RA_and_fit(save_fig= False, show_plot="No")

```
